Here is a summary of my projects:

PROJECT 1 
working with data from one of Africa's largest open data platforms openAfrica to build an ARMA time-series model to predict particulate matter levels in Kenya. Extract data from a MongoDB database using pymongo and improve model performance through hyperparameter tuning.


PROJECT 2 Small Business owners in the US
Building a k-means model to cluster US consumers into groups. They use principal component analysis (PCA) for data visualization, and they create an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash.


PROJECT 3 Predicting apartment sales in Mexico City
Building a linear regression model to predict apartment prices in Argentina. They create a data pipeline to impute missing values and encode categorical features, and they improve model performance by reducing overfitting.


PROJECT 4 EarthQuake Damage in Kavrepalanchok
Building logistic regression and decision tree models to predict earthquake damage to buildings.Also extract data from a SQLite database, and reveal the biases in data that can lead to discrimination.


PROJECT 5 Bankruptcy in Taiwan
Building random forest and gradient boosting models to predict whether a company will go bankrupt. Also navigate the Linux command line, address imbalanced data through resampling, and consider the impact of performance metrics precision and recall.
