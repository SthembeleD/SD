﻿1
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,960
Father.

2
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,640
Thembeka.

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,160
Did you see
what's happening in the city?

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,400
They want us to kill that Afrikaans man

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,480
by voting.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,120
- I don't believe you.
- Look.

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,120
<i>At 5:00 p.m. today,</i>

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,120
<i>we will deliver true justice
and take Harvey's life</i>

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,480
<i>if you choose.</i>

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,200
We need to pray about this.

11
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,200
Look at our country

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,240
slowly spiraling into chaos,

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,480
giving the government the excuse
it wants to steal away our democracy.

14
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,080
This is one more reason
we need to declare state of emergency.

15
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,760
We have to buy more time
to undermine the elections.

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,000
Excuse me.

17
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,080
<i>We're infiltrating.</i>

18
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,000
Any intel yet
on what this is really all about?

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,680
<i>No, but it's working for us.</i>

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,520
Kill him, before whatever
he's really up to becomes a problem.

21
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,960
<i>Numoor! Numoor!</i>

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,560
<i>- Numoor! Numoor!
- Numoor! Numoor!</i>

23
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,760
<i>- Numoor! Numoor!
- Numoor! Numoor!!</i>

24
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Menzi!

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,720
So those police schedules
we lifted off my mom's phone are right.

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,200
We've got, like, a 15-minute gap

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,000
where we can move in
and spray-paint Thabi's stencils.

28
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,640
"Fuck the system"
across Hillbrow police station.

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,200
- It's one of your better ideas, bro.
- Forget about that.

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,560
You are not going to believe
what's happening at the Harvey trial.

31
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,160
Yo! We have to get to the court right now.

32
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,720
What is going on?

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,560
I'll tell you on the way.

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,080
And we need to call all the BSM members.
This is gonna be huge.

35
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,800
Okay, so we are not going anywhere
until you tell me what's what.

36
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,000
Hey. Hey. Are we seriously not going?

37
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,360
I've been working on those stencils
for two weeks.

38
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,040
You can stay if you like.

39
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,640
Fine. Whatever.

40
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,080
Come. Let's go. Let's go.

41
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,920
That's it.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,280
Sir, Maqoma has texted.

43
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,680
I don't care.

44
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,216
- We're going into their trap.
- For goodness' sake!

45
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,280
General Hassen...

46
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,120
Sit down and shut up!

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,160
Seriously, Mashaba,
take it outside.

48
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,520
How many guys we have?

49
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,040
- Did you get a hold of your mom?
- She's not picking up.

50
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,040
But my gut tells me
she's in charge of the hostage situation.

51
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
That a problem?

52
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,800
Fuck you.

53
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,400
I saw a post on Reddit that claims

54
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,360
that these guys fought
in liberation battles in the '60s,

55
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,440
Nazis in Africa,
even older shit like the Crusades.

56
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,760
These guys sound quite serious.

57
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,160
Okay, I call bullshit.

58
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,480
When does the vote open?

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,920
Um...

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,640
You're gonna vote before the retrial?

61
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,840
Yeah. Harvey's guilty as shit.

62
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,720
Doesn't say anything
about the vote opening anytime soon.

63
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
You hear?

64
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,000
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

65
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,320
- Okay, look...
- Guilty.

66
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,760
Okay. I just... I don't know how I feel

67
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,880
about this guy just executing someone
on national television.

68
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,160
We talk about bringing down
the system all the time.

69
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,600
You think that'll happen
without bodies dropping?

70
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,520
Azania's doing the thing
that should be done, okay?

71
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,000
That racist prick is lying.

72
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,280
There was no crime.

73
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,400
He was drunk and full of road rage

74
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,960
and terminated that poor fuck
because he could.

75
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,880
So I mean, what's...
what's the problem, babe?

76
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Is it your mom?

77
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,760
Being a dick comes easy to you, eh?

78
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Am I?

79
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,240
Just drive.

80
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,000
Line the hostages up.
Let them form a human shield.

81
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,200
<i>You, over here.</i>

82
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
<i>On her.</i>

83
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
<i>Start...</i>

84
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,200
Guys. Guys, guys!

85
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,520
They're streaming again.

86
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,680
Karabo Friedman reporting live
from the main criminal courthouse.

87
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,760
Look.

88
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,880
<i>Um, we are with the Numoor.
They have brought us underground.</i>

89
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,280
I'm not sure what we're seeing.

90
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,280
- Come on. Fall back.
- Get ready.

91
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,800
Steady. Steady.

92
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,080
The media's streaming.

93
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,640
Something happening on the livestream.

94
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,760
We need to get
the True Media stream on this screen.

95
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,360
- Go on their live stream.
- Stay on STU cameras.

96
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,200
<i>Retreat,
or we kill the hostages.</i>

97
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,640
Control, what are our orders?

98
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,680
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

99
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,280
I said retreat now! Retreat!

100
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,320
General Hassen,
get them the hell out of there!

101
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,880
- Who took the shot? Who's shooting?
<i>- Take cover!</i>

102
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,240
Oh shit. These fucking cops!

103
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,016
<i>Abort! Abort!</i>

104
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,200
<i>All units abort.
Mission compromised.</i>

105
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,840
Fall back! Fall back!

106
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,160
You just had a journalist shot
while they're livestreaming.

107
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,360
All units back to base.

108
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,080
If anyone thinks
they've got nothing to do,

109
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,760
they can go home and do it,
and don't bother coming back.

110
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,720
Geez, what a shitshow.

111
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,440
- The media's gonna love this.
- Just watch your attitude, Mashaba.

112
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,880
- Let me help you.
- No! Stay back.

113
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,560
I promise I won't hurt you.

114
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,360
Let's go! It's not safe here.

115
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,000
- Okay?
- Okay.

116
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
Shit.

117
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,040
Hurry up. Let's get out of here.

118
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Everyone out!

119
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,560
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Move out!

120
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
This is bad.

121
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,960
We pray that you help us

122
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,320
to find the right path, dear Father.

123
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,520
The police shot a journalist
live on TV.

124
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,840
<i>Now, you know your society's wrong
when the cops are the baddies,</i>

125
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,360
<i>and the hijackers are the heroes.</i>

126
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Breathe.

127
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,080
<i>The heroes have risen
from the shadows.</i>

128
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,520
<i>Numoor! Numoor!</i>

129
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,320
<i>They've come to fight
for the people. The people.</i>

130
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,960
To remember us.

131
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,440
But enough from me. Let's hear
what some of you guys have to say.

132
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,920
<i>I agree with police.
Shoot to kill. We are tired.</i>

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,720
Maybe you should work
for our fascist Minister of Security.

134
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,400
There's a tweet coming out
from Thembi, and Thembi says,

135
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,800
"That terrorist is a hot snack."

136
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,560
<i>A whole buffet. Oh my goodness.</i>

137
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,416
We pray for guidance for our leaders.

138
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,960
Thembeka, what are you doing here?

139
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,080
Why aren't you at school?

140
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,720
Ma'am, come and join us.
We pray for guidance for our leaders.

141
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,680
The leaders don't need her prayers.

142
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,040
We are living in sin.

143
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,720
<i>Police are yet to comment.</i>

144
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,440
<i>But it appears that one of the hostages,
a Truth Media journalist,</i>

145
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,160
<i>was shot by the police.</i>

146
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,000
<i>The fate of the other hostages
is still unknown.</i>

147
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,040
The Numoor were expecting them.

148
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,520
I really wanna know who took that shot.

149
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,200
You know, I'm going to lose it
with this asshole if he keeps pushing me.

150
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,720
You just got off suspension.
Brig, keep it cool.

151
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,360
You know what, Wendy?

152
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,440
Find out who took the shot.

153
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,560
Check the weapons log
and bring me their internal files.

154
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,360
Now we're talking. Yes, ma'am.

155
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,320
That's littering, you know.
You should pick that up.

156
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,200
Coffee.

157
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,040
Okay, there's your boy.

158
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,000
Xolile, my bro.

159
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
How you doing?

160
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,480
Thabs! You despicable human being!
How you doing?

161
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,440
I don't like the way
he speaks to you sometimes.

162
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,720
He's passionate.

163
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,720
No. He just thinks
that this shit is a game.

164
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,120
- Not true.
- Very true.

165
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,120
How much of the BSM stuff
has he taken credit for

166
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,000
that was your idea?

167
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,640
There's a reason why
I don't want too much credit.

168
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
My mom.

169
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,760
I'm just saying.

170
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,400
You don't know him like I do, Thabi, okay?
So just drop it.

171
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,280
Itu! Babes. Chick.

172
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,320
Let's go march and get noticed.

173
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,040
Check out the masks. Check them.

174
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,480
Put them on. Put them on. Put them on.

175
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,600
See, now it won't be so easy

176
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,760
for the fucking cops
to identify or disperse us.

177
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,440
Yeah! <i>Viva la revolución!</i>

178
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
Yeah!

179
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,640
Okay, now who's ready
to go make some trouble?

180
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,880
You're safe now. You're safe now.

181
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,520
Good. Good.

182
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,200
Easy. Easy.

183
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Okay.

184
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,520
There's a fragment here.

185
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,400
- You'll need to take this.
- What is it?

186
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,640
Roots. It's old medicine.

187
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,880
You'll feel almost no pain.

188
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,520
It's not possible.

189
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Hey, hey. Trust me. It'll help.

190
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,680
That stuff is...

191
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,440
Strong?

192
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,880
Okay.

193
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,040
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

194
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,800
Don't worry.
I've done this many times before.

195
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,280
Is that blood?

196
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,320
Over there.

197
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,560
Did you kill someone?

198
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,880
Did you kill someone?

199
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,040
Are you... Are you gonna kill us on camera?

200
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
No.

201
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We have a code.

202
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,200
Move this car.
Cars aren't allowed to park here.

203
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,840
Hello, sir. Please may I go inside?

204
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,720
Get behind the barricades.

205
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,960
Listen to me.

206
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,800
Please may I speak to my husband?

207
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,160
Step back now!

208
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,800
I'm sorry, but my husband works
at the court. I'm begging you.

209
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,160
Step away now.

210
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,720
- No!
- Get behind the barricade now.

211
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,560
My name is Busi Ndou.
My husband works at the court.

212
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,920
- Hey!
- Get behind the barricade.

213
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,880
Ms. Ndou? Ms. Ndou? Ms. Ndou? Ms. Ndou?

214
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,400
Have you had communication inside?

215
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,120
Back up, now!

216
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,040
Back up!

217
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,960
That police thug
wanted to hit me with his stick.

218
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,200
Mrs. Ndou, I am sorry about that.

219
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,160
I promise you,
we are trying to deal with the situation.

220
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,320
We will make sure
the hostages aren't harmed.

221
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,280
But you were attacking them.

222
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,520
What is that?
Do you protect people by shooting them?

223
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,520
I'm really sorry.

224
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,880
He's watching.

225
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,680
<i>Voting is now open</i>

226
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,040
<i>and will be open until 5:00.</i>

227
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,240
Allan Harvey.

228
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,080
On the 6th of May,

229
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Allan Harvey stopped
at a traffic light under an overpass.

230
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,880
Moments later,

231
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,920
Zoliswa Masondo...

232
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,560
<i>was shot in the back while running away.</i>

233
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,240
How do you plead, Harvey?

234
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,520
This is a joke, man.

235
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,560
You deny murdering Zoli?

236
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,680
I took his gun, and I shot him.

237
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,040
But "killed" and "murdered" are different.

238
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,480
You shot him so easily.

239
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,680
He knocked on my window with a gun.

240
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,360
He knocked on your window
to ask for directions.

241
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,200
You were drunk, angry.
You had just been fired.

242
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,840
Yeah, for diversity reasons.

243
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,960
You ever murder a man before this, Harvey?

244
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,280
Kill him in cold blood?

245
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,600
<i>You see a communist,</i>

246
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,880
you shoot a communist.

247
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,240
You see a communist...

248
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,560
You shoot a communist, Captain!

249
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,800
No.

250
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,640
You ever torture a man?

251
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,360
Mr. Maqoma.

252
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,640
Mr. Maqoma.

253
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,080
<i>He either committed the crime,
or he didn't.</i>

254
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,720
<i>His past isn't relevant.</i>

255
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,280
Looks like an innocent man to me.

256
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,680
He looks like you, you mean.

257
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,400
<i>This is not about a moment
in Harvey's life.</i>

258
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,840
This is about his entire life.

259
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,680
You said
you wanted me to defend this man.

260
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
So I will.

261
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,760
Not for him,

262
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,080
but for what's at stake

263
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,920
if madmen like you
can turn justice into a circus.

264
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
So let me.

265
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,160
You can question him.

266
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,600
But you wait your turn. Sit.

267
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,800
You were in the army, Harvey.

268
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,520
Did you enjoy it in the army?

269
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,040
Left, left, left, right, left.

270
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,280
Left, left, left, right, left.

271
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,160
I wasn't there to enjoy it.

272
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Oh.

273
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,040
So you never murdered anyone
while in the army?

274
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,240
<i>It's not murder if it's war.</i>

275
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,720
The shot was taken
by John Ndlovu.

276
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,120
Ndlovu's physical description says
that he's got a tattoo on his chest

277
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
or a brand.

278
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,080
Just like the one on Maqoma.

279
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,120
He's bloody Numoor.

280
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,120
Colonel, is there some sort of problem?

281
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,760
The report says
that you were the one who took the shot.

282
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,680
Like I told my CO,
it really was just a mistake.

283
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,000
Sweaty palms.

284
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,280
So you didn't even aim?

285
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,280
No, sir.

286
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,040
You managed to hit a journalist.

287
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,160
Yeah, unfortunately.

288
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,520
You're new to the unit.

289
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,080
Yeah. Less than three months.

290
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,160
Take off your shirt.

291
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,360
- Excuse me?
- She said take off your shirt.

292
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,280
I will not take off my shirt

293
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,280
until somebody here
tells me what's going on.

294
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,480
I can get you to take off your shirt here

295
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,680
or in a jail cell.

296
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,560
Which do you prefer?

297
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,720
Have you ever killed a man, Maqoma?
Have you?

298
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,560
I'm not the one on trial here.

299
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,680
What's happening here,
it's an abomination of justice.

300
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,120
If we let this happen,

301
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,720
what stops any man from anywhere
doing this again?

302
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,040
Allan Harvey might not be a good person,

303
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,440
<i>but all that matters now is,
did he commit this crime?</i>

304
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,840
<i>Was it self-defense,
or was it a hijacking?</i>

305
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,440
<i>Hijacking?
Nothing proves the gun was Zoli's.</i>

306
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,400
You really believe
that he was asking for directions

307
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,360
in the middle of the night
in an underpass?

308
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Mr. Harvey's guilt has to be
beyond a reasonable doubt.

309
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,640
Ah, you see.

310
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,320
I'm tired of being reasonable, Judge.

311
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Tired.

312
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,960
And I suspect
so are Zoli's mother and brother.

313
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,480
Mama, how do you feel?

314
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,200
Scared.

315
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
Of me?

316
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,400
Oh, you don't need to be.

317
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,160
This... This is your other son.

318
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,200
What do you think, brother?

319
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,640
My brother wasn't guilty.

320
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,520
I don't care what he or she says.

321
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
She's a sellout.

322
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,760
You hear that, Judge?

323
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,600
This young man is implying
that the system hasn't changed.

324
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,640
It just got new management.

325
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,360
Any thoughts?

326
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,160
I would say you've forgotten
what it really was like before liberation.

327
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,480
Oh, I remember.

328
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,280
Thandi. Thandi. Thandi.

329
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,920
<i>Thandi!</i>

330
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,440
But what has changed? Really?

331
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,560
Everything.

332
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,000
No.

333
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,600
No, no, no, no, no.

334
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,520
The gatekeepers just have a new skin tone.

335
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,520
But unemployment skyrockets.

336
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,560
Liars rule!

337
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,080
The state is captured by thugs.

338
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,480
Fuck you, Azania.

339
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,000
Captured by criminals,
and this court does nothing.

340
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,680
- What do you think, Mrs. Harvey?
- Leave her.

341
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,616
- What do you think?
- I said leave her!

342
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
Tell us.

343
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,000
The data traffic
is coming in from everywhere.

344
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,800
We can't identify the source
of the packets.

345
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,440
I've just been insulted
in front of the whole country.

346
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,240
Why are they still able to broadcast?

347
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,040
We can't block the system
using terrestrial means, sir.

348
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,200
They're not broadcasting in the spectrum.
They're using the Internet.

349
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,216
- Cut them out.
- We are trying to, but we...

350
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,280
- Hack into their systems.
- They're using a complex VPN.

351
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,160
The guy who's manning the attack is...
They're ghosts.

352
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,760
Get in through their website.
Crash it. Hack it. Make it collapse.

353
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,520
Look. Look at Zoliswa's mother.

354
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,680
- Mr. Maqoma!
- Look! Look at Zoli's mother.

355
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,920
- Mr. Maqoma, may I speak?
- No!

356
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
Look.

357
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Mama?

358
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
Tell us

359
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,680
about Zoliswa.

360
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,080
Zoli was a good boy.

361
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,400
Zoli was a good boy.

362
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,880
Good with his hands.

363
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,160
He did what his father did,

364
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
carpentry,

365
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,560
gardening...

366
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,840
Mm-hmm.

367
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,080
And every cent he made
went to Shaka's education.

368
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,760
How did his death make you feel, Mama?

369
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,440
Zoli worked so hard to try and help us.

370
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,440
You think we eat every day?

371
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,720
You think it doesn't cost
to live in this country?

372
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,160
Everything costs.

373
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,960
He died trying to keep us alive.

374
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,400
Hey, you.
Are you really voting to kill someone?

375
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,600
Piss off, you.

376
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,800
Leave me alone. I have a right to vote.

377
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,840
Mrs. Masondo.

378
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,800
You said your son would do anything
to make money for the family.

379
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,240
Yes.

380
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,200
Did he ever commit crimes to do so?

381
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,320
Zoli's a good boy.

382
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,640
You believe that he may have been
a hijacker, don't you?

383
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Shut up!

384
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,080
She doesn't.

385
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,600
You are a sellout here.

386
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,000
You're the sellout.

387
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,640
Hey.

388
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,080
You're watching, right?

389
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,720
<i>People are gonna kill this guy.</i>

390
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,840
Yeah, they're voting already.

391
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,400
<i>Not a lot. A couple of thousands.</i>

392
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,160
But it's not looking good for Harvey.

393
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,520
<i>But how did
Karabo even pull this off?</i>

394
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
Luck, I guess.

395
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,680
Have you ever heard of these guys before?

396
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
The Numoors?

397
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
No.

398
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,720
Are you lying to me?

399
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,000
- No.
<i>- I don't believe you.</i>

400
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,560
- So fucking what?
<i>- Baby, listen to me.</i>

401
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,920
<i>I know our take on things
has been far-left.</i>

402
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,440
But this? No. We have to be careful
about what's happening.

403
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,920
- Why?
- Because this country is reeling.

404
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,160
I mean, this shit
could blow out of control.

405
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,480
It could trigger riots.

406
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,160
Good.

407
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,120
Baby!

408
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,760
<i>These are terrorists.</i>

409
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
Maybe.

410
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,160
But you should fucking see our numbers.

411
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,760
<i>I think the people
that are supposed to be our heroes</i>

412
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,480
<i>are actually the ones
that are denying us all the justice.</i>

413
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,480
<i>The Numoor are here
to fight for us.</i>

414
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,160
<i>They are the ones who know the truth.</i>

415
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,080
- Amandla!
- Awethu!

416
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,840
Maqoma and the Numoor
should pop that <i>umlungu,</i>

417
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,640
like they say
the Numoor popped colonialism,

418
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,120
because we are oppressed.

419
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,440
- Amandla!
- Awethu!

420
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,160
- Amandla!
- Awethu!

421
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,816
So, what are you Numoors
attempting to achieve

422
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,800
with this farce of a trial?

423
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,840
Hmm?

424
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,360
When your leader was talking,

425
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,600
when he first took the court,
he said this is just the beginning?

426
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,840
Now, who the fuck is Abel,

427
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,120
and what are his weekend plans?

428
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,680
You should be happy.

429
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,680
Those responsible for your husband's death
will finally see justice.

430
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,600
- This is the second time you people...
- Mashaba!

431
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,680
There's a large crowd gathering.

432
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,240
- Go deal with it.
- Sir, that's Bongani's job.

433
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,880
This man is part of the Numoors.
It's far more important.

434
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,120
- He mentioned...
- I want this man taken to Central.

435
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,160
- But, sir.
- Go oversee Bongani.

436
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,320
Deal with the crowd.

437
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,520
He'll be interrogated later.

438
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,560
Or should we call the minister?

439
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,000
If you cannot affect change
by a democratic means,

440
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,240
then the only solution
is organized revolution.

441
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,800
What are your thoughts
on Minister Kunene's desire

442
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,400
to declare a state of emergency
this coming weekend?

443
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,120
All it is going to do
is make these elections harder to manage,

444
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,200
that is, if they happen at all.

445
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,240
You think you can keep
the state of emergency going that long?

446
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,720
Itumeleng,
is this why you were calling me? Huh?

447
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,480
You shouldn't be here.

448
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,800
I was phoning to give you the courtesy
of knowing this is happening, Ma.

449
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,400
You don't even have a protest permit.

450
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,456
If you think
you'll get special treatment from me...

451
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,480
Brigadier Mashaba...

452
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,560
Nice to see you.

453
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,200
Don't you mess with me, boy.

454
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,480
- I eat punks like you for breakfast.
- Ma.

455
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,560
Itumeleng, this is a bad situation.
You need to get your people out of here.

456
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,240
We've had this conversation so many times.
I'm doing what I believe in.

457
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,120
Like Dad taught me.

458
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,600
Don't do that. Don't you dare
use your father's name to win arguments.

459
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,360
I'm not arguing, okay?
This system is screwed.

460
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,360
Things have to change.

461
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,440
That man...

462
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,920
has stolen the courthouse.

463
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,720
The cops shot someone.

464
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
Not them.

465
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,680
I'm sick to my stomach of the idea

466
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,840
that a racist prick like Harvey
can get off.

467
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,160
I agree with this.

468
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,520
- We are led.
- You keep quiet.

469
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,360
Are you going to vote
for that man's death?

470
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,240
You know what? Maybe I am.

471
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,800
Itumeleng, you're going
to be part of a murder.

472
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,400
Everyone is going to be complicit
in his murder.

473
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,680
"It's not murder if it's war."

474
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
Itumeleng Mashaba.

475
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,600
This is going to get out of hand.
Itumeleng.

476
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,520
Hey, medicine boy.

477
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,800
Ah.

478
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,120
This looks cozy.
What's happening here?

479
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,280
You flirting,
licking powders,

480
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,080
when you should be guarding the prisoner?

481
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,520
What do you want?

482
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,400
Snow White looks
sexy enough to eat.

483
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,400
What do you want?

484
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,520
It's almost time for the heroic comeback.

485
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,160
She needs longer to clear her head.

486
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,920
Don't take too long, young hero.

487
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,640
- I said she'll be out when she's ready.
- Yeah. Whatever you say.

488
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
Fuck.

489
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,920
In the basement...

490
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
that man...

491
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,960
he pointed his gun at me.

492
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,960
He shot me on purpose.

493
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,520
You knew it was going to happen?

494
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,400
That's the root talking.

495
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,680
Getting me shot was part
of some bigger plan, wasn't it?

496
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,080
- Oh, God.
- Stay still.

497
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,640
I don't need your help.

498
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
Look at me.

499
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,560
Look at me.

500
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,160
You were never in any danger,
I give you my word.

501
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,480
Now, relax.

502
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,240
It'll be over soon.

503
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,200
These government amateurs have been trying
to hack the site for 45 minutes.

504
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,560
So what are you going to do?

505
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,880
Shit! We've been hacked!

506
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,400
What's Paladin?

507
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,440
Shaka,

508
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,080
what do you think?

509
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,000
He was just trying to find that bar,
where he could get that job.

510
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,440
And this one killed him.

511
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,240
This racist asshole killed him!

512
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
You killed him.

513
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,040
You are the one who killed him.

514
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,160
You racist bastard! You killed him!

515
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,640
- You killed him! You killed him!
- My son is not a racist.

516
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,840
Your son is not a racist?

517
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,360
No.

518
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,960
Let's call to the stand Mrs. Harvey,

519
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,240
Allan's dear old mummy.

520
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,960
Leave her alone.
She's got nothing to do with this.

521
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,120
She raised you.

522
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,040
Hate is learned.

523
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,080
I hate criminals, not Blacks.

524
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,800
- You think Blacks <i>are </i>criminals.
- No, that's not what I said.

525
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,440
Maria, to the stand. Now.

526
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,920
Leave her alone. Leave me, man.

527
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,800
- Move.
- Oh.

528
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,560
Mrs. Harvey,
you say your son isn't a racist,

529
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,880
but he grew up in Apartheid South Africa.
So how is that possible?

530
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,560
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

531
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,920
We gotta move, Harvey! Move!

532
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,440
We're overrun.
We need to get out of here.

533
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,480
Let's get to the river.

534
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,960
Get them! Get them!

535
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,440
Maqoma.

536
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,120
Stay down!

537
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Stay down!

538
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,000
Stay down! Don't move! Don't you move!

539
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
You.

540
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,360
Finally.

541
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,040
Where do you think you're going?

542
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,680
Get up. Move. Move.

543
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,240
The first one that talks lives.

544
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,960
Take out your sidearm, Harvey.

545
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,960
- Should we not take them in, sir?
- Take out your sidearm!

546
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,960
You're gonna tell me where your base is,

547
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,800
otherwise this boy here
is gonna shoot your fucking brains out.

548
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,840
Talk!

549
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,920
Talk!

550
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,080
Shoot the communist.

551
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,120
I think we should take them in.

552
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,040
Shoot the bloody communist,
you sniveling asshole.

553
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,400
Shoot the communist!

554
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,040
Are you not a patriot, Harvey?

555
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,400
I am, sir!

556
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,200
- Are you not a God-fearing Christian?
- I am, sir!

557
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,600
Then shoot the communist!
Shoot the communist!

558
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,400
Shoot the fucking communist!
